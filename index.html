		<div class="content">
			<p>Bishops and Knights is a puzzle consisting of a 2n x 2n grid. The goal is to correctly place bishops and knights in the grid so that every row and 
				column contains the same number of each. Every cell contains a number that indicates the number of pieces of the same type that the piece in 
				that cell can attack/be attacked by. The pieces move in the same way that they move in chess. Assume that pieces do not block attacks when 
				computing this number for bishops or knights. For example, a clue of 5 in a cell indicates that there is either a bishop in that cell that can 
				attack five other bishops or a knight in that cell that can attack five other knights.</p>

			<p>Bishops and Kings is a puzzle consisting of a 2n x 2n grid. The goal is to correctly place bishops and kings in the grid so that every row and 
				column contains the same number of each. Every cell contains a number that indicates the number of pieces of the same type that the piece in 
				that cell can attack/be attacked by. The pieces move in the same way that they move in chess. Assume that pieces do not block attacks when 
				computing this number for bishops or kings. For example, a clue of 5 in a cell indicates that there is either a bishop in that cell that can 
				attack five other bishops, or a king in that cell that can attack five other kings.</p>

			<p>Kings and Knights is a puzzle consisting of a 2n x 2n grid. The goal is to correctly place kings and knights in the grid so that every row and 
				column contains the same number of each. Every cell contains a number that indicates the number of pieces of the same type that the piece in

		<button type="button" class="collapsible">Fairy Chess Sudoku</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Fairy Chess Sudoku is a puzzle consisting of a 5n x 5n grid. The goal is to correctly place bishops, knights, camels, manns, and princesses in the 
				grid so that every row and column contains the same number of each. Every cell contains a number that indicates the number of pieces of the 
				same type that the piece in that cell can attack/be attacked by. Bishops and knights move in the same way that they move in chess. A mann 
				moves like a king does in chess. A camel moves in an L shape like a knight, but moves to a square that is three squares away horizontally and 
				one square vertically, or three squares vertically and one square horizontally. A princess moves like both a bishop and (not or) a knight. 
				Assume that pieces do not block attacks when computing this number for any piece.</p>

		<p>All credit for creating Bishops and Knights, Bishops and Kings, Kings and Knights, and Fairy Chess Sudoku goes to David Nacin.<br><br>

			David Nacin is the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Math-infused-Sudoku-Puzzle-Variants-Difficulty/dp/1470450909">Math-Infused 
			Sudoku</a> and a professor at William Paterson University. He enjoys designing and studying puzzles that involve partition identities, the motion of 
			chess pieces, finite groups, and other mathematical structures. He maintains a mathematical puzzle blog at 
			<a href="http://quadratablog.blogspot.com/">quadratablog.blogspot.com</a>.<br><br>

			The csv files generated are a file containing the requested puzzles and a file containing the solutions to those puzzles. Bishops and Knights, Bishops 
			and Kings, and Kings and Knights asks whether you want puzzles generated with an obvious starting place or not. An obvious starting place is any cell 
			that has a value great enough to easily determine the piece that belongs there. For example, if you are playing Bishops and Knights, a knight in a 
			corner cell can only hit two other knights at most. If the value in a corner cell was greater than 2, a bishop would obviously go there because a 
			knight cannot. Choosing yes would therefore generate puzzles that are more difficult. It is only possible to generate puzzles of size 4, 6, and 8 with 
			this property.<br><br> 

			I hope you enjoy playing these puzzles as much as I have!<br><br>
